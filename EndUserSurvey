// NOTE: This is an interview survey given to the END USERS stakeholder group of the Type1 app. //

1. What are some of the technological challenges of being: 
    (Main: a person diagnosed with type 1 diabetes)?
    (Alt: a caregiver to a dependent with type 1 diabetes)?
2. How many technologies (hardware, medical devices, applications, programs, etc.) do you use to manage (your/their) care?
3. If you currently have an app that you use - what is the best function it offers, and what is something you wish that it had? 
4. (Alt only) How old do you think your dependent would be before he could manage their care, at least in part, 
    through a phone or web application? 
5. Would you prefer a diabetes management app that was very complex but customizable, 
or one that was straightforward and only did a few important functions? 
6. Would you use a social feature of a diabetes application:
    to read Q&A forums 
    chat with other caregivers, or 
    ask experts questions (like a nutritionist)?
7. How do you currently share diabetes-related information to (your/your dependent's) school, caregivers, or physician 
    (through paperwork, verbal communication, online forms, etc.)?
8. Is there anything that you would wish for in a diabetes application?
